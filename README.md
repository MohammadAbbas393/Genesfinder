## Introduction

This project involves a series of functions written in Python for analyzing DNA sequences. The functions include identifying stop codons, finding open reading frames (ORFs), generating reverse complements of DNA sequences, and filtering ORFs based on their lengths. Additionally, the project includes functions for reading DNA sequences from FASTA-formatted files and writing ORFs to such files.

## Functions

### 1. `is_stop(codon)`

Checks if a string is a stop codon.

### 2. `orf_sequence(DNA)`

Finds and returns the ORF from a string that starts with a start codon without a stop codon.

### 3. `find_orfs(DNA)`

Finds and returns ORFs from DNA sequences of codons of 3 bases.

### 4. `reverse_complement(DNA)`

Reverses a DNA string by switching the bases with their complementary ones.

### 5. `gene_finder(DNA)`

Finds and returns specific genes from a DNA sequence using potential frames and reversed ones.

### 6. `read_fasta(filename)`

Reads a single DNA sequence from a FASTA-formatted file.

### 7. `filter_orfs(orfs, min_length)`

Filters ORFs to have a minimum length.

### 8. `write_fasta(filename, orfs)`

Writes a list of ORFs to a FASTA-formatted text file.

## Usage

To use these functions, import the module into your Python script and call the desired functions with appropriate arguments.

Example usage:

```python
import dna_analysis

sequence = dna_analysis.read_fasta("X73525.fasta.txt")
orfs = dna_analysis.gene_finder(sequence)
filtered_orfs = dna_analysis.filter_orfs(orfs, 690)
dna_analysis.write_fasta("genes.txt", filtered_orfs)
```
